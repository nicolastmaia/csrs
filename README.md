# CSRS
This was my final graduation project for my university course in Information Systems. It's a Recommender System for georreferenced content for another project called CidadeSocial, developed by professors and students from UFRRJ and UFRJ.
In this project, georreferenced items are taken from a PostgreSQL DB and indexed to Elasticsearch to be later recovered by the CSRS application. 
The actual CSRS application is written in SpringBoot and combines georreferenced items with users' interest tags to create a list with items recommended for a specific user.
